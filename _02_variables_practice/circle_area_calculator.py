# Goal: Write a Python program that asks the user for the radius 
#       of a circle and displays the area of that circle.
#       The formula for the area of a circle is Ï€r^2.
#       See example image in package to check your output.

    # Make a new turtle

    # Have your turtle draw a circle with the correct radius
    # my_turtle.circle()
    hi.circle(self = 1, radius =)
    # Call the turtle .penup() method
    hi.penup()
    # Move your turtle to a new x,y position using .goto()
    hi.goto()
    # Calculate the area of your circle and store it in a variable
    # Hint, you can use math.pi
    math.pi
    # Write the area of your circle using the turtle .write() method
    # my_turtle.write(arg="area = " + str(area), move=True, align='left', font=('Arial',8,'normal'))

    # Hide your turtle

    # Call turtle.done()
